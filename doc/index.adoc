[[overview]]
== Overview ==

The Tensei-Data software system can be used to merge, standardize and
simplify data integration, data migration, data transformation and
interface management processes.

These processes can be manually executed or automatically by specified
routines or triggers that are monitored.

The system is based on modern technologies like _Akka_, _Scala_ and the
_Play Framework_. Therefore, the application is scalable, flexible and highly
performant.
The integrated Data Description Language (_DFASDL_) allows the dynamic
mapping of almost any source and target system and is called within the
application as `dynamic connectors`.

For the modification of data, the Tensei-Data application offers diverse
`transformers` which can be combined and modified.

[[overview-features]]
=== Features ===

*Key features of the Tensei-Data system are:*

Dynamic Connectors:: The structures of the source and the target system
can automatically be retrieved and expressed via the integrated Data
Description Language (DFASDL). That allows the connection of
standardized and individual resources.
Referential Integrity:: Existing dependencies (Primary keys, Foreign
Keys) between the data are automatically considered and integrated into
the target system. That preserves the correctness of the referential
integrity when depending keys are changing.
Normalization:: Normalization allows the extraction of data from the
source system and avoids redundancies in the target system. Tensei-Data
extracts the data depending on the specifications and provides the
created dependencies for the linking of the dependent data.
Virutal Views:: Tensei-Data allows the creation of virtual views on the
existing data which create new relations and aggregations.
Transformers:: A row of basic transformers are already included in the
Tensei-Data system to modify the data in diverse ways. Multiple
transformers can be connected in series to execute various modifications
on the data. This flexibility enables endless ways to transform data
regarding diverse use cases.
Automatic Execution:: The execution of the integration and
transformation processes can be established continuously or manually.
For the continuous execution are Cronjobs (time-based execution) or
Trigger (event-based execution) available.
Scalable:: The system is based on a modern software stack of Scala and
Akka. The advantages of this agent based system are scalability by the
Akka cluster and parallelization that can be upscaled depending on the
number of available agents.
Diverse database systems and file types:: Tensei-Data supports various
<<overview-connections,databases and file types>> and provides connection out
of the box.

_Additional features are_:

* Automatic description of the data structure
* Complex integration tasks can be subdivided into subtasks and automatically
executed
* Besides the graphical frontend exists an admin mode that allows the 
specification of database dependent queries
* Filtering of data
* Export / Import of existing cookbooks for reuse
* Intuitive mapping visualization
* Extreme short training periods

[[overview-objectives]]

[[overview-structure]]
=== Structure and Components ===

Tensei-Data is designed as microservice application structure and
consists of the following components:

Frontend:: Administer the Transformation Configurations for executing
the integration and transformation processes. The graphical editor
allows the definition and adaptation of all process relevant steps.

Server:: Administer the connection between the frontend and the
registered agents.

Agent:: Agents are the workhorse of the Tensei-Data system and finally
execute the Transformation Configurations.

[[installation]]
== Installation ==

The installation of the Tensei-Data system can be done by using a
<<installation-vm-windows,Virtual Machine for Windows>>, a
<<installation-vm-linux,Virtual Machine for Linux>> or the
installation of <<installation-debian-packages,Debian packages>>.

|========================================================

[[installation-vm-windows]]
==== Windows ====

The following steps describe the installation of the required components to
execute the Tensei-Data system.

===== Installation of VirtualBox =====
VirtualBox is a virtualization software that is available for various systems.

. Download the `Windows Installer` from https://www.virtualbox.org/
. Execute the `Installer` and follow the instructions

===== Installation of Vagrant =====
Vagrant is used to create the system that executes the Tensei-Data components.

. Download the `Windows Installer` from https://www.vagrantup.com/
. Execute the `Installer` and follow the instructions

TIP: The system must be rebooted after installing Vagrant.

===== Installation of the Tensei-Data Demobox =====

1. Create an empty folder.
2. Open a command prompt in the created folder.
3. Enter the command `vagrant init wegtam/tensei-demo` at command prompt.

To start the demo version a command prompt has to be opened in the created·
directory. At the prompt the following command starts the demo version:

[source]
----
vagrant up
----

image::windows_eingabeaufforderung_vagrant_up.png[scaledwidth=100%,align="center"]

* The first start of the system takes a while.

* You can access the system at http://localhost:9000

image::windows_localhost_9000.png[scaledwidth=100%,align="center"]

* You can stop the system with
[source]
----
vagrant halt
----

* If you have problems during the start, you have to start the processes by
  hand: <<installation-faq>>

* The demo is installed and can be restarted with `vagrant up`

[[installation-vm-linux]]
==== Linux ====

1. Create an empty folder.
2. Open a command prompt in the created folder.
3. Enter the command `vagrant init wegtam/tensei-demo` at command prompt.

To start the demo version a command prompt has to be opened in the created·
directory. At the prompt the following command starts the demo version:

[source]
----
vagrant up
----

After the VM has started the application, the frontend is available under the
following address: http://localhost:9000

The first booting of the virtual machine may take longer because the vagrant
box must be decompressed and installed.

IMPORTANT: If the following error message `Server connection unavailable`
appears on the screen, the services must be started manually.
<<installation-faq-services>>

The VM can be shutdown via `vagrant halt` or via `vagrant suspend`. To
boot it again just use the `vagrant up` command.

The virtual machine will not shutdown automatically with the shutdown of the
host system. The VM may be damaged if it is not shutdown properly.

* If you have problems during the start, you have to start the processes
  by hand: <<installation-faq>>

[[installation-vm-replace]]
==== Replace an existing Vagrant-Box ====
If you want to replace an existing Vagrant-Box, you must execute the following
steps.

IMPORTANT: If you want to keep existing Cookbooks, you must export them.

. Switch to the folder where the actual Vagrant-Box is installed
. You can see the status of the box with `vagrant status`
. Destroy the box with `vagrant destroy`
. List the added boxes with `vagrant box list`
. Delete the actual Vagrant-Box with `vagrant box remove NAME-OF-THE-BOX`
.. If the box has the name `tensei-demo`, the box can be removed with the
following line: `vagrant box remove tensei-demo`
. Install the new box like described in the <<installation>>.

[[installation-vm-uninstall]]
==== Uninstall ====
For a properly uninstallation of the application the command `vagrant destroy`
has to be executed. Afterwards the working directory may be deleted.

TIP: In `C:\Users\<username>.vagrant.d\boxes\` (Windows) or
`/home/<username>/.vagrant.d/boxes/` (Linux), a copy of the VM is stored that
can be removed manually.

[[installation-manual]]
=== Manually ===

[[installation-manual-requirements]]

[[installation-manual-preparations]]
==== Preparing the installation ====
If all requirements have been installed the database has to be prepared.
The following sections describe the steps needed for that.

[[installation-manual-preparations-users]]
===== Create user accounts =====
If each component should be run with an individual user account then
these accounts have to be created.

The system consists of the following components:

. Server
. Agent (At least 1 agent is needed.)
. Frontend

[[installation-manual-server]]
==== Tensei-Server ====
The server component is delivered via a file called `tensei-server.txz`.
This file has to be extracted at the desired execution folder. During
extraction a folder like `tensei-server-A.B.C` will be created. For
convenience this folder should be renamed to `tensei-server`.

The subfolder `conf` contains several configuration files including the
file `logback.xml` which can be used to adjust the logging.

[[installation-manual-server-start]]
===== Start script and parameter =====
The start scripts are located within the subfolder `bin`:

- `tensei-server`
- `tensei-server.bat`

According to your operating system you have to chose the proper file
(for example `tensei-server.bat` for a Windows system). To start the
application several parameters have to be set. These are explained in
the following section.

[[installation-manual-update]]
==== Update ====

[[installation-manual-update-preparations]]
===== Preparations =====

Before you can update the system you have to shutdown each component.
This can usually be done with the following commands:

[source]
----
sudo service tensei-agent stop
sudo service tensei-frontend stop
sudo service tensei-server stop
----

IMPORTANT: If you have created an agent cluster then all nodes in the
cluster have to be shutdown too.

Now the files containing the new version can be copied onto the machine.
Afterwards you can decompress them there.

WARNING: If the configuration files (`tensei.conf`) have been modified
then you must backup those files to be able to reapply your
modifications after the update.

[[installation-manual-update-tensei-server]]
===== Server =====

[[installation-faq]]
=== FAQ Installation ===

[[installation-faq-ssh-support]]
==== Installation of SSH support for Windows ====
If no SSH support is available on your Windows system, you can install Git as
one alternative.

. Download the `Windows Installer` from https://git-scm.com/
. Execute the `Installer` and follow the instructions

SSH is neccessary to execute the `vagrant ssh` command

[[installation-faq-reload]]
==== The system is not correctly loaded by vagrant ====
If the system does not run correctly after the first `vagrant up`, you should
reload the system.

.Reload the system
[source,bash]
----
% vagrant reload
----

[[installation-faq-services]]
==== Services do not start ====
In rare circumstances some services (frontend, server, agent) may not be started
correctly for example the tensei-server or the tensei-agent.

Sometimes it is enough to <<installation-faq-reload,reload the VM>>. If not, the 
following steps can be executed.

To resolve this issue you should login to the virtual machine using the
`vagrant ssh` command. From within the VM you can restart the services:

.Connect to VM from Shell
[source,bash]
----
% vagrant ssh
----

.Restart server
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-server restart
----

.Restart agent
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-agent restart
----

.Restart frontend
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-frontend restart
----

If it generates an error message during the restart of one of the services
(because the service is not running), this service can be started with one of
the following commands.

.Start the server
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-server start
----

.Start the agent
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-agent start
----

.Start the frontend
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-frontend start
----

[[installation-faq-frontend-restart]]
==== Frontend doesn't run and can not be restarted ====

If the VM was incorrectly stopped, the frontend service can be corrupted.
The service can not be restarted.

If so, you have to delete the `RUNNING_PID` file within the frontend folder.

.Connect to the VM in the shell
[source,bash]
----
% vagrant ssh
----

.Delete the RUNNING_PID file
[source,bash]
----
% rm /srv/tensei/tensei-frontend/RUNNING_PID
----

Restart the frontend service.

.Restart frontend
[source,bash]
----
% sudo service tensei-frontend restart

[[configuration]]
== Configuration ==
The system has various possibilities for configuration. The user can configure
different aspect of the <<configuration-frontend, frontend>>. More specific
configurations can <<configuration-direct, directly>> be done at the single
components.

[[configuration-frontend]]
=== Frontend ===
The first user must be created after the installation. This user is
automatically created with administrator rights. The form to create
this first account will automatically be shown during the first access
of the system.

Specific functions are only available for the administrator:

. Create and administer user accounts
. Create and administer user groups
. Update the Tensei-Data license

[[configuration-direct]]
=== Configuration files ===
Some settings are available via configuration files and specific
parameters. The following sections describe the configuration of the
single system components.

[[configuration-direct-agent]]
==== Agent ====

The identifier of an agent is randomly generated at the first start. This
identifier can be customized in the file `tensei-agent-id.properties`. This file
defines a key-value pair:

[source]
----
tensei.agent.id=NAME_OF_AGENT
----

NOTE: The identifier of the agent should not contain any special characters or
blanks.

Any other configuration is made in the file `tensei.conf`.

[[agent-cluster]]
=== Cluster agents ===
An agent can be started on several computers (clustering). The following
instruction must be observed.

In the current cluster model, the main node provides the essential work
(parsing, processing) and uses the other nodes to distribute the amount of
data. In the future, other nodes should also be used to parallelize the work.

IMPORTANT: All nodes within the cluster must define the same ID for the agent
(`tensei.agent.id`)!

The agent directory must be copied to all relevant computers. Afterwards, one 
computer must be defined as seed-node.

IMPORTANT: The seed-node must always be started as first!

The following system properties can be used for the configuration of the 
cluster on the single nodes:

.Configuration variables for the agent
|=======================================
| Variable | Description | Default
| `tensei.agent.hostname` | The hostname or the IP-address of the node.
| `localhost`
| `tensei.agent.port` | The port number of the node. | `2551`
| `tensei.server.hostname` | The hostname or the IP-address of the server.
| `localhost`
| `akka.cluster.seed-nodes.0` | The address of the main seed-node. |
`akka.tcp://tensei-agent@localhost:2551`
|=======================================

IMPORTANT: The address of the seed-node must be a valid Akka-Cluster-address:
`akka.tcp://tensei-agent@HOSTNAME:PORT`!

The parameters can be set via `-D...` when executing the start script or
adapted in the file <<configuration-direct-agent-tensei-conf, tensei.conf>>.

[[agent-cluster-faq]]
==== FAQ ====

How to add a new node?:: A node is simply installed and started on a computer.
A few seconds later, it should be available in the frontend.

How to remove a node?:: The node is stopped and no longer available for the
cluster.

Can I add a node, if the system is running?:: When a transformation
configuration is executing, the nodes should not be changed!

What happens, when the seed-node is restarted?:: If the seed-node is restarted,
all other nodes of the cluster must also be restarted.
